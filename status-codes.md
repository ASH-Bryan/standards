#Status-Codes Standards

The purpose of this document is to help both sides client/server-sides of development understand what Ember accepts.

##Put

On a put from any Ember-App using Ember-Data I will be happy with either:

`A - 204 with No-Content`

`B - 200 with {}`

`C - 200 with Object`

###Why?

##Delete

On a Delete from the Ember-App I expect a

    `204 - with no content.`

from the server.

###Why?
